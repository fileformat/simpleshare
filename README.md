Simple-Share
============

This is a simple site to redirect to one of the social sharing sites.  It is really just so I don't have to use a third-party service that bloats my pages with a ton of Javascript and tracks my viewers.

There are more details on the [FAQ](https://simpleshare.io/) and you can see the source code on [Github](https://www.github.com/fileformat/simpleshare).
